  # AppCustom.CredentialsMap is a map of SecretName -> Comma separated list of mac addresses.
  # Every SecretName used here must also exist as a valid secret in the Secret Store.
  #
  # Note: Anything not defined here will be assigned the default credentials configured via `DefaultSecretName`.
  #
  # Example: (Single mapping for 1 mac address to 1 credential)
  #   credentials001 = "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff"
  #
  # Example: (Multi mapping for 3 mac address to 1 shared credentials)
  #   credentials002 = "11:22:33:44:55:66,ff:ee:dd:cc:bb:aa,ab:12:12:34:34:56:56"
  #
  # These mappings can also be referred to as "groups". In the above case, the `credentials001` group has 1 MAC
  # Address, and the `credentials002` group has 3 MAC Addresses.
  #
  # The special group 'NoAuth' defines mac addresses of cameras where no authentication is needed.
  # The 'NoAuth' key does not exist in the SecretStore. It is not required to add MAC Addresses in here,
  # however it avoids sending the default credentials to cameras which do not need it.
  #
  # IMPORTANT: A MAC Address may only exist in one credential group. If a MAC address is defined in more
  # than one group, it is unpredictable which group the MAC will end up in! If you wish to change the group a MAC
  # address belongs to, first remove it from its existing group, and then add it to the new one.
